So this is it! My first blog ^_^

Creating and writing a blog might be on most people's new year resolutions or bucket-list or to-do list but the majority end up slacking off. I managed to finally set it up from a template and then write my first ever blog post.

I always loved writing. I never wrote about anything in particular, but I liked to document my life, one incident at a time. I write when I'm travelling( feels classy opening my mac on a flight to write something ;) ) or am sad/depressed/had enough/annoyed with my life and then look back after a few days/weeks/months/years and smiled. That's the only writing I ever did(apart from writing stories in my childhood: you know the drill).

But now, I'm going to write articles HERE. They would be simple incidents/thoughts from my daily life which I'd love to share :)

Love
Anuj
